# Reverse Polish Notation Calculator
A reverse polish notation calculator that was built for coursework to emulate the functionality and quirks of a legacy program. Replicating the original meant inserting the same bugs, such as a broken implementation of the shunting-yard algorithm (figuring out the subtle way it was broken was the trickiest part of the exercise). It even led to me porting the GLIBC random number generator to Java to generate the same sequence of numbers as the original. Whilst rather contrived, I think that this project shows my attention to detail and ability to write clean code despite an odd set of requirements. It was graded 100% and passed every unit test that was thrown at it, which according to the tutor who marked my work was a first.
