# Reverse Polish Notation Calculator
A reverse Polish notation calculator that was built for coursework to emulate the functionality and quirks of a legacy program (only the binaries were provided). Replicating the original meant inserting the same bugs, such as a broken implementation of the shunting-yard algorithm (figuring out the subtle way it had been sabotaged was the trickiest part of the exercise). It even led to me porting the GLIBC random number generator to Java to generate the same sequence of numbers as the original. Whilst rather contrived, I think that this project shows my attention to detail and ability to write clean and succinct code despite an odd set of requirements.
